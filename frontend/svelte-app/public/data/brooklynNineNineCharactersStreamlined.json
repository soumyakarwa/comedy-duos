        "Episode Description": "Detective Jake Peralta finds his work scrutinized when new Captain, Ray Holt, takes over at his precinct.",
        "Wiki Fandom Descriptions": "Detective Jake Peralta is a talented, but carefree police detective at Brooklyn's ninety-ninth precinct who, along with his eclectic group of colleagues, are used to having a lax captain around the office. However, when tightly-wound Captain Ray Holt takes over, he is determined to make this dysfunctional group of detectives into the best precinct in Brooklyn.",
        "Wikipedia Episode Descriptions": "The 99th precinct of theNew York Police DepartmentinBrooklynreceives a new Commanding Officer, Captain Raymond Holt. Much to the dismay of talented but carefree Detective Jacob Peralta, and the satisfaction of the by-the-book Detective Amy Santiago, Holt takes police work much more seriously than the previous captain. Holt gets to know his detectives through Sergeant Terry Jeffords, their dedicated but emotionally unsteady leader. Meanwhile, Detective Charles Boyle, a committed but not physically gifted officer, asks Gina Linetti, the sarcastic civilian administrator, to help him ask laconic and tough Detective Rosa Diaz out on a date. Jake gets on Holt's nerves by refusing to take his orders, like wearing a neck tie, seriously.",

All of the squads are being audited, and the 9-9's auditor is Amy's ex-boyfriend Teddy, who hasn't forgotten that Amy dumped him with encouragement from Jake. Jake and Amy end up in a comedy of errors in alternately trying to make nice with Teddy and keep him from finding out they still think he's the most boring man alive. At the precinct, Holt tasks Terry to fix a $21,000 Japanese copier that former Captain C.J. ordered, and Boyle and Diaz have to deal with a rat infestation emergency. Gina returns much too early from being badly injured when hit by a bus and uses her status to help fix the 9-9's maintenance issues, while Teddy eventually recuses himself from auditing his ex's squad. The new auditor is a woman who used to date Terry, despises him in the present, and tells him that she's going to shut the 9-9 down for good.",

The plan falls apart due to the Vulture and C.J.'s ineptitude and Holt's distrust of Wuntch. Wuntch seemingly betrays the team to Kelly and has them all arrested, but it's later revealed to be a ruse by Jake so she could get access to Kelly's phone. Kelly is suspended and Wuntch becomes acting commissioner until they can find a replacement. As this is going on, Terry is in denial over getting transferred to Staten Island, until Wuntch uses her temporary position to alter the budget and allow Terry to stay at the Nine-Nine. However, because Holt inadvertently revealed to Wuntch that he only spent a month as a uniformed patrolman before becoming a detective, which is in breach of NYPD rules, she forces him back into uniform to make up for his missing time.",

The heist is set up to be a trip down memory lane covering the squad's endeavors for the last eight years with several returning faces contributing to it, including Gina. At the same time, Terry is applying to become the new Captain of the 99th Precinct, but the ongoing heist makes him wary about his interview. All of the squad members end up locked together when Jake's, Amy's, and Holt's plans for the \"perfect goodbye\" all end up clashing with each other, where Jake confesses to them that he is leaving the Nine-Nine and Holt tells Terry he's already been accepted as the new Captain. They eventually make it back to the precinct, where they find that Hitchcock has also returned and won the heist. The crew enjoys their last night together and reflect on the previous years before exiting the building. A year later, Jake, Rosa, Amy, Gina, and Holt return to keep the Halloween Heist tradition alive, joining Charles, Scully, Hitchcock, and the now Captain Jeffords at the precinct.",
